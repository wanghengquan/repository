16/03/17 real-time print out post/pre-process flow's running message


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16/01/11 add "set exitonerror 1" for ActiveHDL Simulation do template file

16/01/08 will run simulation flow no matter of the status of implementation flow.

16/01/04 re-generate the DiamondDevFile.xml when no Device Settings found from it.
         remove run_ice.py under bin folder.

15/11/24 make simulation flow run without tb_file specified.

15/11/23 make test flow running without simulation file for scuba cases(Douglas).
         run_par_trce is the default pushbutton flow if no others flow will be launched

15/11/17 set environment for pre/post flow:
         internal_diamond_path, internal_modelsim_path, internal_questasim_path,
         internal_riviera_path, internal_icecube_path

15/11/13 add "--run-export-ami" to run Export IBIS AMI Model flow for Device like LFE5UM-85F-6BG756C.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.3 @ 10/15/2015

15/09/01 sys.exit value is different in windows and linux, so need change the exit value when Linux.

15/8/13 Sometimes the lpf file for scuba cmd is not a standard ini file, so skip it and find the
        scuba command from srp file and itself.

15/8/12 If simulation license not available, the simulation flow will be relaunched in 10 times.

15/8/11 Douglas put the ldf in the design root path, so add the function to get the ldf file if:
        1) no info file found; 2) no ldf file found in ./par.

15/7/9 update pmi vhd file with new family name(Tony)
       add default %(resolution)s for Questasim simulation do file (Sally)

15/7/2 Zhilong need add check conf file for qas cases (rtl vs map_vlg simulation lst file)
       use the default.xml file as DiamondDevFile.xml when failed to create it.

15/6/23 add --run-export-xo3l for XO3L export flow: Bitgen4Xo3l and Jedec4Xo3l. (JYe)
        fix bugs for getting the right testbench files when running simulation
        copy all files/dirs under $ldf_file base path if copy_all is True, previous only copy some few files

15/4/16 Name the DiamondDevFile.xml file with current Diamond version number

15/4/13 run rtl simulation directly if --scuba-type=xx --sim-rtl and without other simulation options

15/4/13 Match the Diamond path loosely by option: --loose-match.
        rules:
        1) if --x86, search x86 build first, then x64.
        2) if no --x86, search x64 build first, then x86.

15/3/27 Classic project file can be found in ./fit folder.

15/3/23 add --set-env="clean_a=1;clean_b=2" for user's environment value

15/3/20 some design failed when run till_map flow. the run_till_map.log only have 3 lines.
        ==============================
        pnmainc run_till_map.tcl
        Elapsed Time: 16.83 seconds
        RERUN it.

15/3/20 copy v/vhd/vh/ngo files to _scratch if found them in the ldf same path by add "--copy-all"

15/3/17 add --info to search the info file in the root design path
        check the top-dir before check the design path
        copy ngo file if found .ngo file in the ldf path

15/3/2  --till-map and --map-done to make sweeping flow faster.
       >> --till-map at first
       >> --map-done only run sweeping necessary flow

15/2/13 temporary lib name for XO3LF simulation
15/2/6  Rerun PMI flow when found "Error in pmi elaboration" in the log file
15/2/4  Update scuba command line for memory file

14/12/23 Support precision in tcl mode (Why license not found when user changed?)
14/12/23 launch very old ldf file which does not have bali version. previous treat it as an error.
         now just give warning message.
         Sometimes you just want to use others path same as the ldf path, so .recovery cannot be copied
         to scratch directory.
14/12/17 when one process is generating DiamondDevFile.xml, others will wait in 15 minutes
14/12/17 add scuba-only for scuba-type flow
14/11/27 support run-ncl flow after running ldf flow
14/12/02 support iCECube LSE flow, update command line
14/12/04 update bugs for some designs will keep the wrong status
         as new2nd or processing for very long time (db_search.py)




-- Version 1.0.2
 * print error message line if command failed.
 * fix bugs parsing a non-exist ldf file
 * get right uut name for qas cases
 * exit 1/0 for the test flow only, the 1/0 comes from check flow

-- Version 1.0.1 (released 3-July-2014)

 * copy and update .conf (check config file) to the jod dir for checking flow (EN018)
 * use PrjName as the default project_name in command flow (EN017)
 * will copy node_file.txt which can be found in the original sty file
 * add --scuba-type=<vhdl|verilog> to run scuba test cases, must specify the --devkit in the command line
 * remove --sim-tag for PMI simulation flow
 * add --pmi for running pmi test flow and simulation flow
